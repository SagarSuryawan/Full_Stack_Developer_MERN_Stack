 Whatâ€™s z-index and How does it Function ?


 explaination -The "z-index" property in CSS determines the stacking order of elements in the vertical or z-axis direction. It controls how elements are layered and displayed on top of each other when they overlap. The higher the z-index value, the closer the element is to the viewer, and the more likely it is to be displayed on top of other elements.
