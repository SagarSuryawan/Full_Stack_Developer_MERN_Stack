Whats difference between Inline, Inline Block and block ?

Explaination:- 

1)inline element =  inline element are those element are inline ,they do not break line line or do not break line.

code = display:"inline"


2)block element = block element are those element which full width of container or parent element,so next element goes to next line.

code = display:"Block" 

3)inline-block = inline-level elements but behave like block-level elements. They flow within the text, but they can have width, height, margins, and paddings applied to them. Unlike inline elements, inline-block elements can have line breaks before and after them.

code = display: inline-block
