 Difference between absolute and relative and sticky and fixed position explain with example.

 Explaination -

 realative Position - Setting the top, right, bottom, and left properties of an element with position: relative; property will cause it to adjust from its normal position. The other objects or elements will not fill the gap.


 Absolute Position -An element with position: absolute; will cause it to adjust its position with respect to its parent. If no parent is present, then it uses the document body as parent.


 Fixed Position - property applied to an element will cause it to always stay in the same place even if the page is scrolled. To position the element we use top, right, bottom, left properties.

 Sticky Postion -An element with sticky positioning is initially positioned relative to its normal position, and then becomes fixed when the page is scrolled.
