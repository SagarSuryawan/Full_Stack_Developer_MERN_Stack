What is VW/VH

Explaination - VW (Viewport Width): 1 VW is equal to 1% of the viewport's width. For example, if the viewport width is 1000 pixels, 1 VW would be 10 pixels. So, 50 VW would be 50% of the viewport's width.

VH (Viewport Height): 1 VH is equal to 1% of the viewport's height. Similar to VW, if the viewport height is 800 pixels, 1 VH would be 8 pixels. Therefore, 75 VH would be 75% of the viewport's height
