    <!-- ðŸ’¡ **Q.6** Imagine you are a web developer working for a creative agency that specializes in building visually appealing and interactive websites. The agency has recently received a client request to create a landing page similar to the design of the one-page website: https://www.getonecard.app/. The client wants to showcase a video prominently on the page to engage visitors.
    
    Your task is to create a simple webpage that replicates the one-page landing page design, including a responsive layout and an HTML video. The below images are for your reference. Some browsers donâ€™t allow you to play videos without the controls attribute. So, you can add controls here, we will learn how to play a video without the controls attribute in the later sections. -->
