<!DOCTYPE html> is it a tag of html? If not, what is it and why do we use it?

yes, <!DOCTYPE html> is indeed a tag in HTML, specifically the document type declaration. It is not a regular HTML tag in the sense that it doesn't define any visible content or structure on a webpage. Instead, it serves as an instruction to the web browser about the version of HTML being used in the document
