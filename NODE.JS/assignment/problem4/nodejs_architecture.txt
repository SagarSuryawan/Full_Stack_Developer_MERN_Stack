Node.js is a platfrom that utlilize javascript and is primarily empolyed for developing web applicationthat are highly focused on input/outputoprations,but not limited to chat apllication and multimediawebsites.The Platfrom is constructedusing google chrome's V8 javascript engine.A web application is a type of software that executes on a server and is displayed by a client's browser that obtain all the application's resources over the internet  compared to other server side language,node.js has distinct advantages.It asynchronous model and non-blocking I/O operation improve scalability and performance of web application build on other framworks.Node.js can easily handel multiple client request without requiring multiple threads ,consuming less memeory and resources.Additionally ,it is highly scalable and provides high performance.Node.js is also flexiable with multiple framworks and make the development process easier. compared to other server side language,node.js has distinct advantages.It asynchronous model and non-blocking I/O operation improve scalability and performance of web application build on other framworks.Node.js can easily handel multiple client request without requiring multiple threads ,consuming less memeory and resources.Additionally ,it is highly scalable and provides high performance.Node.js is also flexiable with multiple framworks and make the development process easier. compared to other server side language,node.js has distinct advantages.It asynchronous model and non-blocking I/O operation improve scalability and performance of web application build on other framworks.Node.js can easily handel multiple client request without requiring multiple threads ,consuming less memeory and resources.Additionally ,it is highly scalable and provides high performance.Node.js is also flexiable with multiple framworks and make the development process easier. compared to other server side language,node.js has distinct advantages.It asynchronous model and non-blocking I/O operation improve scalability and performance of web application build on other framworks.Node.js can easily handel multiple client request without requiring multiple threads ,consuming less memeory and resources.Additionally ,it is highly scalable and provides high performance.Node.js is also flexiable with multiple framworks and make the development process easier. compared to other server side language,node.js has distinct advantages.It asynchronous model and non-blocking I/O operation improve scalability and performance of web application build on other framworks.Node.js can easily handel multiple client request without requiring multiple threads ,consuming less memeory and resources.Additionally ,it is highly scalable and provides high performance.Node.js is also flexiable with multiple framworks and make the development process easier.
