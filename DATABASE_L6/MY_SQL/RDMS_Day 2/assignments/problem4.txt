Q4. Explain the different types of Keys in RDBMS considering a real-life scenario.

Ans => Key is attribute or a set of attribute than can uniquely identify each row in a table.

i)Primary Keys  ii)candidate key  iii) foreign key  iv) Alternate key  v)Artifical key  vi) Super key  vii) composite key



i) Primary key =>It is a key choosen from from candidaite key that is used as unique indentifer.

ii)Candidate key => It is set of one or more attributes [columns] that can uniquely identify each row.

iii) foreign key => This key is used To establish a link between two tables.

iv)Alternate key => This key is a candidate key in a database that can be uniquely identify rows but but not choosen as a primary key. It is key all keys from candidate key but not including Primary key.

v)Artifical key =>  An artificial key is a key generated by a database management system to uniquely identify records in a database table. This is usually done if the primary key combination is too lengthy or there exists no primary key.

vi)Super key => Key is attribute or a set of attribute than can uniquely identify each row in a table

vii)Composite key => a composite key is a primary key in a relational database that consists of two or more columns used together to uniquely identify record.It is combination of columns tpo find rows.
