Q8. List out the different levels of Normalization and explain them in detail.

There are four levels of Normalization
i)1NF    ii)2NF  iii)3NF     iv)BCNF

i)1NF  => i) It is called first normal form.
         ii) A tables be in 1NF it has to fullfilled two condition,first there should be primary key and secound is there should be no cell in the tables having multiple values.
          
ii)2NF => i)It is called secound normal form.
         ii)It has two condition that's needs to be fullfilled.
        iii)First condition is tables in 1NF,means primary key has to be there and cell should not have      multiple value.
        iv)Secound condition is partial fraction dependency means column in tables depends only part of the primary key rather than entire primary key.

iii)3NF => i)It ic called third normal form.
          ii)It have to fullfilled two conditions.
         iii)frist is tables should be 2NF[means tables has to fulled 2NF conditions]
         iv) Secound is there should be no transitiv dependency means  chain of attribute dependencies where the value of one attribute depends on another attribute.

iv)BCNF => i)It is called Boyce-Codd Normal Form
          ii)If every functional dependency X â†’ Y, X is the super key of the table or in simple words,If Y depends on X -hen X should be a par- of -he primary key
