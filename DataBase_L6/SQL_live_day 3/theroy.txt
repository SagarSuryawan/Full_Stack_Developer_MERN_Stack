1)MY_SQL
i) download MY_SQL ,to download any sofware take help from medium artical or youtube videos.keywords mysql installation windows 10 medium/youtube.
ii)In command prompt  to enter in mysql command, 
iii) mysql -u root -p ,press enter,enter password.
iv)here we can write sql commands.SQL [structure query language]
v)sql is declarative language means SQL does not need user algorithm to perfrom on data,SQL have own algorithm  for output.
vi)In RDBMS data in a from of table,to perfrom action like ADD, DELETE, READ, UPDATE  data SQL is used to perfrom this action.

vii) to list all datases   => show datases;      {semi colan is manditaory}

viii) to create database  => create database DATABASE NAME;

xi) to select datbase  => use datbase name;   after that all operation is for only given database 

x) to delete database => drop database database name;

11) create tables in database  => create table  Movies (Movie_Name varchar (1000), rating integer)

    Movies is a names of tables and  movies_Name is column or property in tables varchar is datatype.
    after property there has to be datatype of column or datatype.

12)add data into tables  => insert into movies (name,rating) values (PK,3.5)

above (name,rating) values (PK,3.5)  this is order of inserting values in tables. if rating was before name interger value 3.5 is before PK

13) to retrive data tables or print data from tables => select * from movies
meaning => select -> Means get the data and print integer, * -> all row and column or you can write one or more column name.
from movies -> means from movies tables.


14) to add multiple data one syntax  ==> insert into movies (movie_Name,rating) values (),(),(),();
add multiple parenthesis after value and in parenthesis add data .

15) to clear command scrren ==> \! cls

16) to print data from tables which satisfy given condition ==> select * from movies where rating > 5[condition].we can use  "or" & "and" operatoe like in javascript;
 note: only above 5 rating movies will print from database.

 17) we can equal to operator like " = " not neccessary ==.


18) PREFIX MATCHING  search based on statring with specific chars.

 ==> select * from movielist where moviename like "sp%"  

starting with sp and after no matter what char should be.



19) SUFFIX MATCHING serch based on ending with specific char.or numbers.

==> select * from MoviesList where moviename like "%an";

moviename ending with an adter no matter what is befor that.


20) find data with exact character or number in table.
 ==> select * from movielist where moviename like "%e%";

 in the query output will all movies name haveing name "e";

 
 21) find data in range  => for example  salary from 15000 to 100000;

 ==> select * from empolye where salary betweem 15000 and 100000;

 where empolye is tables name and salary is column.



22) find  multiple data respective any single column;

==> select * from empolye where id[column] in (1,3,5,7,9)

above query is find multiple based on given id.
id is column name.




23) delete data from table;

==> delete from empolye[table name] where first_name = "sagar";

this query delete row from tables where first_name = "sagar";




24)update any data from table.

==> update empolye[table name] set roll_no = 149 where roll_no = 129;

abovew query change the value of row having roll_no = 129 to 149;


25) JOINS 

i) INNER JOIN => In inner join merge commom data from different table.with the help of primary key  from one table is foregin key from another table.

INNER JOIN BETWEEN TWO TABLES.

QUERY=> SELECT name,role,state from empolye join address on empolye.address_id = address.address_id;


name,role is from table one and state from another table, empolye join address tables and on basis of address _id form empolye and address table.


INNER JOIN BETWEEN THREE TABLES.

QUERY => SELECT name,role,city,state FROM empolye JOIN address on empolye.address_id = address.address_id JOIN city ON city.city_id = address.address_id;


first join two tables where we get name role and state and join city table,primary key from city tables is equal to foregin key from address table.



II)LEFT OUTER JOIN => In left outer join all data return from left table[table 1] and common data from both tables.
ALL DATA FROM ADDRESS TABLE [LEFT TABLE] AND COMMON DATA FROM BOTH TABLES

query ==> SELECT name,role,state,area FROM address left outer JOIN empolye ON empolye.address_id = address.address_id;


III) RIHGT PUTER JOIN => in outer right join return all data from right tables[tables 2] and common data from both tables.
ALL DATA FROM RIGHT TABLE[EMPOLYE TABLE] AND COMMON DATA FROM BOTH TABLES.

QUERY ==> select name,role,state,area from address right outer join empolye on empolye.address_id = address.address_id;



26) find the length of column    

query ==> select city,length(city) from city

OUTPUT ==> it will retunr a column new column having length.


27) distinct mreans unique (not repeating)

query => select distinct city from city;

above query print all city from city table but not duplicate  city or repeating city.



28) if else and nested if else;


29)

i)QUERY ==> select count(*),district from address group by district limit 10;

it will give you no. of element for district ,group by return one row.


ii)condition only on group;

Query => select count(*) as count,district from address group by district limit 10 having count > = 5;
