1) mysql console  ==>    mysql -u root -p

2)list of databases ==>  show databases;

3)create database ==> create database Movies;      Note:Movies is name of database.

4)delete database ==> drop database Movies;

5)to select database ==> use Movies;

6)create tables in database ==> create table MoviesList(name varchar(100),rating integer);
Note: in the above syntax tables name is MoviesList (column_name varchar is datatype (100) limit,rating is column name integer is datatype).

7)add data into tables ==> insert into MoviesList(name,rating) value ("spider man", 4.5);

8) print and retrive data from tables.
i)select * from MoviesList;
ii)select column name form MoviesList;

9)add mutiple data in single line ==> insert into MoviesList (name,rating) value (),(),(),();

10) To clear comaand scrren \! cls

11) print selected data from table which satisfy given condition ==> select * from movies where rating > 5.we can use "and"  & "or" like javascript.we can also use "equal to operator " by "=".no need of == or === .

only selected data will print which satisfy given condition.



12) prefix matching is a concept that frist some character match in given data.
    For example = you search person name from your phone contacts.
    QUERY ==> select * from movielist moviename like "spi%"

14)find data with ecact character or number in table.

 ==> select * from movielist where moviename like "%e%";

 in the query output will all movies name haveing name "e";


 15)  SORTING DATA 

 i) we can sort data in asending and descending order.
 ii) we can sort by number and word .

 ==> select * from movielist order by rating asc; 
 above query data sort in asending order based rating column.

 ==> select * from movielist order by rating desc;
 above query sort data in desending order based on rating column.

 ==> select * from movielist order by moviename;
 above query sort like dictnary from .

 ==> select * from movielist where moviename like "%p%" order by rating asc;
above query sort data haveing moviename p in asending order.

==>select * from movielist order by moviename ,rating asc
above query sort data by moviename and rating in asending order.



16) suppose we have 100 row of data ,so need to print only 10 row 
==> select * from movielist limit 3;
above query print only three row of data .

oofset is used for startfrom ,means data is start printing from given offset value.

==> select * from movielist limit 5 offset 5;

data start printing from 6th row and print 5 rows starting from 6 position.



17)change/UPDATE data from table.

update movielist set moviename = "endgame" where moviename = "spiderman1";

change moviename spiderman1 from endgame.Update spiderman name to endgame.
