What is the significance of Data modelling and explain the types of data modelling.


Conceptual Data Modeling:Focus: High-level view of data without delving into technical details.
Purpose: Represents business concepts, relationships, and major entities.

Abstraction: Independent of the physical data storage and technical considerations.

Outcome: Conceptual schema or Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERDs).
Logical Data Modeling:

Focus: Represents data independently of the database management system.nships, and constraints.
Abstraction: Abstracts from physical storage details but considers implementation aspects.
Outcome: Logical schema, often depicted through ERDs or Unified Modeling Language (UML) class diagrams.
Physical Data Modeling:

Focus: Specifies how data will be physically stored in the database.
Purpose: Translates the logical model into a design that aligns with the chosen DBMS.
Abstraction: Accounts for database-specific features, indexing, storage optimization, and performance considerations.
Outcome: Detailed schema including tables, columns, data types, indexes, and relationships.
